# Master's Thesis - Efficacy of the WorkKeys ACT Assessments in Predicting Student Success in Postsecondary Career Technical Education and Industry Recognized Credential Attainment

This study examines the efficacy of the ACT WorkKeys assessments in predicting student success within postsecondary Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs at C-TEC Postsecondary. Using a comprehensive analysis of data from students who have either withdrawn or completed their postsecondary CTE program, the research evaluates the predictive strength of student scores on three ACT WorkKeys assessmentsâ€”applied math, graphic literacy, and workplace documents. The findings reveal that higher scores on these assessments correlate with student success, defined as successfully completing a program and successful attainment of industry recognized credentials. This study's insights suggest potential improvements in educational policy and practice, advocating for the integration of these assessments into the student admissions processes to ensure successful educational and employment outcomes. Additionally, utilizing complementary admissions criteria along with entrance exams is recommended. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of considering additional demographic variables, such as age, race, gender, and economic disadvantage in predicting student success. Overall, this study contributes to the broader discussion on the role of entrance exams in educational achievement and workforce preparedness in the postsecondary CTE context.
