CHAPTER I: Introduction
	Entrance exams are an essential component for admission into postsecondary education institutions but can be a source of anxiety for many students (Çirak, 2016; Steedle, 2018). These requirements are set in place to ensure that potential students are prepared for the level of education they are pursuing and avoid unnecessary failures due to a lack of academic ability (Steedle et al., 2019). While research on postsecondary education entrance exams has focused on pre-college students, little emphasis has been placed on conducting research within adult postsecondary education centers, also known as postsecondary career technical education (postsecondary CTE), vocational, or trade centers (Frey, 2019; Wao et al., 2017). In recent years, there has been a notable rise in demand for specialized trade and industry jobs that require education beyond a high school diploma in the United States. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of adult students seeking admission into postsecondary CTE centers to obtain industry credentials and certificates (Rainie et al., 2022; Parker & Roumell, 2020; Morthland, 2010). However, research on postsecondary CTE centers and their use of entrance exams is lacking. 
	The ACT WorkKeys assessments were designed to serve as a diagnostic tool to identify potential employees who are job-ready for prospective employers (MPR Associates, Inc. & Academy for Educational Development National Institute for Work and Learning, 2006; ACT WorkKeys – Workforce Development Solutions, 2023). In some secondary schools in the United States, these assessments have been implemented as a measure of workplace readiness for secondary CTE exit requirements for students, or as a potential pathway for graduation (Steedle & Girdler, 2020). However, the requirements for entrance exams in postsecondary CTE centers remain poorly understood, and further research is necessary to examine the impact of entrance exams within postsecondary CTE centers, as well as the reliability of the ACT WorkKeys assessments in predicting student success in such settings (Edgerton, 2022; Erwin, 2019). 
	Students enrolled in postsecondary CTE centers often encounter distinctive challenges that set them apart from pre-college, high school students. Typically, these students have been away from educational institutions for a prolonged period of time and harbor significant anxiety towards academic and testing environments (Castañeda, 2017). Additionally, these students generally maintain full-time employment and face familial obligations while enrolled in postsecondary CTE programs (MacDonald 2018; Smith, 2013; Postsecondary CTE, 2023). Furthermore, students who come from lower socio-economic backgrounds often enroll in postsecondary CTE programs to obtain well-paying jobs that can enhance their quality of life within a shorter timeframe than a traditional four-year degree program would permit (Ahearn et al., 2016; Advance CTE, 2020a). 
	To identify potential barriers for alternative educational pathways, assessing the effectiveness of an entrance exam’s ability to predict success for students who enroll in postsecondary CTE programs is imperative to the success of current and future postsecondary CTE students. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the ACT WorkKeys assessments on predicting student success in postsecondary CTE programs (as defined by graduating from an enrolled program), obtaining an industry recognized credential (defined by earning at least one industry recognized credential that is not the NCRC), and securing a job in the program field after completion of their enrolled postsecondary CTE program. This study also aims to investigate if retake status (defined by having to retake at least one of the ACT WorkKeys assessments) and the number of retakes a student must complete on the ACT WorkKeys assessments to meet the desired program cut off score impacts the prediction of student success. 
Background of the Problem 
	Postsecondary career technical education, or postsecondary CTE, has played an important role in the history of education in the United States. Also referred to as vocational education, trade school, or adult education centers, postsecondary CTE centers were first designed to provide hands-on training for adults lacking skills required to obtain a job that requires less education than a traditional 4-year degree, but more than a high school diploma (Edgerton, 2022). Determined imperative by the United States federal government for economic growth and prosperity of the country, vocational education first focused on developing adults’ knowledge in agriculture, home economics and mechanical works (Parks & Shoemaker, 2007, pg. 4; Kim, 2023). Changing with a rapidly evolving industrial economy, postsecondary CTE centers now offer programs in healthcare services, welding and HVAC trades, mechanic trades, construction, manufacturing, and IT (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.). 
	The growth and change of postsecondary CTE during the 1900’s was no match for the popularity of the traditional college pathway. Used as a method of tracking and segregating students, postsecondary CTE was labeled as alternative education and was perceived to be an option only secondary to a four-year university degree (Xing et al., 2019; Kim, 2023; Allen & Sconing, 2005). Postsecondary CTE centers were typically composed of students who were considered minorities and special needs students; these students were also more likely to come from lower socio-economic families (Advance CTE, 2020; Dougherty & Lombardi, 2016). With lack of support for postsecondary CTE due to bias that ran rampant during this time period, less support was provided by the local or federal governments to encourage the growth of postsecondary CTE centers, leading to low student enrollment outside of traditional four-year college education (Gauthier, 2020; Waugh, 2018; Lotto, 1988). However, the value of an education that can be obtained from postsecondary CTE programs is starting to gain popularity in the United States, as postsecondary CTE centers have started to rebrand their public perception (Advance CTE, 2020a). However, some negative perceptions of postsecondary CTE centers still exist (Butrymowicz, 2016). 
	Although the ACT WorkKeys assessments are not currently recognized as a standard postsecondary education admissions assessment, the traditional ACT exam has been widely used by colleges to predict students’ academic success (Allen & Sconing, 2005; Belasco et al., 2015). However, in light of growing concerns about excessive testing and the accessibility of postsecondary education for underrepresented minority and low-income students, many educational institutions have begun implementing test-optional policies for incoming applicants (Rosinger et al., 2021; Belasco et al., 2015). While incoming freshman ACT entrance exam scores have been extensively studied, other measures, such as a student’s high school GPA (HSGPA), have been shown to be more reliable predictors of academic success in postsecondary education (Allensworth & Clark, 2020; Woods et al., 2018). Nonetheless, there has been considerable debate over the reliability of HSGPA as an indicator of academic success, given inconsistencies with school funding and curriculum, as well as teacher bias in assigning grades (Woods et al., 2018). Moreover, research suggests that standardized test scores are often unreliable in predicting student success when examining minorities and low-income students' scores (Belasco et al., 2015). 
	Using entrance exam scores to deny admission to students based on their academic ability can potentially save them from future financial stress, as college dropout rates among unprepared students can result in unexpected costs in the form of student loans without the stability of a four-year degree and the potential for a higher income (Rosenbaum et al., 2015). However, entrance exams can be useful tools for identifying students who may need additional academic support, such as remedial classes in math and English (Woods et al., 2018). Data collected from entrance exams can also guide educational policies aimed at developing skills that promote higher scores on these assessments (Royster et al., 2015). 
	The ACT WorkKeys assessments are used nationally by high schools, colleges, and employers as a measure of students’ workplace readiness for employment (National Career Readiness Certificate - ACT Workkeys, 2023). Given that the primary goal of postsecondary CTE centers is to assist students in obtaining employment quickly after graduating, assessing student preparedness for the workforce is essential to student success (Lefebvre & Steedle, 2019). However, denial of admission based on testing scores can prohibit a student from ever obtaining these skills (Steedle et al., 2019). 
	Enrolling into postsecondary CTE programs provides a pathway for adults to escape poverty and achieve financial stability (Ohio Board of Regents, 2014; Lefebvre & Steedle, 2019). Students who graduate from a postsecondary CTE program gain specific industry knowledge and skills, and therefore have a higher chance of finding steady employment than those with only a high school diploma (Steedle et al., 2019; Royster et al., 2015). Employers also benefit from postsecondary CTE enrollment, as employers save valuable time and resources that would have been otherwise spent on employee training (Advance CTE, 2021). Furthermore, the sustained employment of postsecondary CTE program graduates increases the state’s economic well-being and could reduce the dependence on state resources, such as welfare and subsidized health care (Ohio Board of Regents, 201; Sosulski, 2021). This economic benefit continues with children of adults who attend postsecondary education, as they are much less likely to repeat the cycle of generational poverty (Engle, 2007). 
Statement of the Problem 
	Research examining the success rate based on student ACT scores, college admissions, and student success has been thoroughly researched. The ACT has been established as a valuable assessment that predicts student success in college courses. Further, the impact of postsecondary education has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of those who graduate from postsecondary institution. Students who further their education after obtaining a high school degree are more likely to hold a stable job and have little to no dependence on state assistance programs. Additionally, children of adults who complete a postsecondary education degree or program are more likely to continue this trajectory and become productive, hardworking citizens. 
	While ACT scores are positively linked to student success in college, and postsecondary education benefits are well known, much less is understood concerning adult success in postsecondary CTE programs. Conflicting terminology in the field of postsecondary CTE as well as lack of information regarding entrance exams in postsecondary CTE admissions creates cause for concern (Kosloski & Ritz, 2016; Brixey & Keily, 2021). The option of postsecondary CTE as a pathway for postsecondary education should be a less complicated option for adult students who hold a job, juggle financial and family obligations, and have less free time than traditional college students. 
	The need for this study is to examine the effectiveness of the ACT WorkKeys assessments in determining the success of adult students who enroll in postsecondary CTE centers. Entrance exams may act as a barrier for some students; understanding this barrier can help determine a solution for assisting them in developing foundational academic skills. If the ACT WorkKeys assessments are shown to be an effective tool in predicting student success in postsecondary CTE centers, schools may consider implementing programs to better assist students who cannot pass the assessments. Further, if the ACT WorkKeys assessments are not effective in predicting student success in postsecondary CTE centers, policies should be changed to better evaluate students who wish to enroll in these programs. 
Purpose of the Study 
	The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which the ACT WorkKeys assessments predicts student success in postsecondary CTE programs. This study will test four independent variables: student scores on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments (applied math, graphic literacy, and workplace documents), and if the student had to retake one or more of the ACT WorkKeys assessments to meet the minimum cut score required to enroll into their desired program. 
	The ACT WorkKeys assessments are compiled of three separate tests: applied math, workplace documents, and graphic literacy (ACT, 2017). Admission into any program at C-TEC Postsecondary is contingent on meeting the predetermined cut-off scores for the specific program the student wants to enroll into. Cut off scores for each program offered at C-TEC Postsecondary vary based on the diversity of programs; these scores are determined with the help of the testing center coordinator, program coordinators, instructors, and advisory committees of professionals who are knowledgeable in the field. This study will evaluate if earning a higher score on each of the three ACT WorkKeys assessments indicates that a student will be successful in their program. Additionally, this study will examine the impact of retaking any of the three ACT WorkKeys assessments in order to achieve the minimum cut score required.
	This study will evaluate three dependent variables: students’ success in their postsecondary CTE program, industry recognized credential obtainment, and obtaining a job in a career aligned with the chosen program’s field. Student success is defined as graduating from, or completing, an enrolled program, earning at least one industry recognized credential aside from the NCRC, and obtaining a job in the program's field after graduating, respectively. Failure is defined as withdrawing from or failing out of an enrolled program, not earning at least one industry credential, and either obtaining a job in an unrelated field or not obtaining a job at all after completing a postsecondary CTE program. 
	To gain a better understanding of how the ACT WorkKeys assessments predicts student outcomes, this study will consider economically disadvantaged status, age, race, ESOL status, employment status at the time of enrollment, and gender. This study will be conducted in a suburban city that has a predominantly Caucasian population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). However, many students who enroll at C-TEC Postsecondary live in surrounding areas, including Columbus, Ohio's capital, which has a large immigrant and refugee population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022a; New Americans in Columbus, 2023). 
Significance of the Study 
	This study aims to contribute to the growing body of research on postsecondary CTE centers and entrance exams. As the popularity of postsecondary CTE increases among the general public, there is a need for guidance on the significance and importance of the entrance exams required by postsecondary CTE centers. Moreover, as the entrance exam requirements are not universally equivalent across postsecondary CTE centers, this study aims to determine whether the scores obtained on the ACT WorkKeys assessments can predict the success of postsecondary CTE students. 
	This study seeks to investigate if the ACT WorkKeys assessments are effective predictors of student success in postsecondary CTE programs, attainment of industry recognized credentials that align with the program career field, and ultimately, successful job placement in that field. Furthermore, this study aims to investigate whether retaking one or more the three ACT WorkKeys assessments has a significant impact on student success. By examining the effectiveness of the ACT WorkKeys assessments as a predictor of student success in postsecondary CTE programs, this study has the potential to impact and influence policy regarding student remediation, particularly in the areas of math, reading, and test taking skills. Implementing policies to increase remediation could reduce barriers for postsecondary education and improve the lives of adults in need of steady employment. 
Primary Research Questions 
Q1. Are scores on the ACT WorkKeys assessments for the students’ prospective C-TEC Postsecondary program and retake status on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments significant predictors of student success in the students’ chosen postsecondary program at C-TEC Postsecondary? 
Q2. Are scores on the ACT WorkKeys assessments for the students’ prospective C-TEC Postsecondary program and retake status on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments significant predictors of success in obtaining an industry recognized credential in the students’ chosen program field of work? 
Q3. Are scores on the ACT WorkKeys assessments for the students’ prospective C-TEC Postsecondary program and retake status on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments significant predictors of success in obtaining a job in the students’ chosen program field after graduating the program? 
Research Design 
	The study focuses on previously enrolled students who have either withdrawn or graduated from a postsecondary CTE program at C-TEC Postsecondary. Data for the study will be collected from C-TEC Postsecondary, including scores earned on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments received from the Testing Center, graduation status, industry recognized credential attainment as reported by instructors, and student employment data collected by instructors after a student completes the program. The data will be analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques to determine if scores earned on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments are reliable predictors of student success. The analysis will also examine if retaking any of the three ACT WorkKeys assessments impacts student success. 
	The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the three ACT WorkKeys assessments as predictors of student success in postsecondary CTE programs. Additionally, further analysis will examine whether factors such as economically disadvantaged status, age, race, ESOL status, employment status at the time of enrollment, and gender contribute to predicting student success. Analysis of this data was obtained using the R studio statistical package (R Core Studio, 2022). 
Theoretical Framework 
	This study considers the theoretical framework of human capital that was first introduced by Gary S. Becker in his work on the effects of investment in human capital on earnings. In his investigation into the returns on higher education, Dr. Becker found a lack of information on the theory of investment in human capital (Becker, 1964, p. 7). Subsequent research has further developed this theory and generalized it in various domains. Human capital is considered to be the foundation of economic growth and innovation for both business and nations (Hao et al., 2023). 
	The human capital theoretical framework is particularly relevant to postsecondary CTE, as students invest in programs to increase their income-earning potential. This, in turn, increases the productivity of businesses and contributes to the growth of local, state, and national economies. High-level skill development is the driving force of economic growth, making it essential for local, state, and national governments to prioritize policy changes that increase the human capital of lower socioeconomic and minority groups (Hao et al., 2023). Postsecondary CTE programs can improve the human capital of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and offers practical education that is relevant to prospective job requirements, providing opportunities for continuous education and upward mobility that might not be available with just a high school diploma. Evaluating the importance of postsecondary CTE in terms of human capital is essential, as it can directly impact the lives of individuals who are struggling. 
	The development of human capital may not be the sole factor contributing to an individual’s success in the workforce. Therefore, the human capital framework might also consider social and cultural values of individuals, including the development of soft skills that enhance employability and productivity in the workforce (DeJaeghere et al., 2016). Research suggests that developing social understandings can create significant changes in the lives of students, particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Such developments allow students to feel valued by their teachers and peers, helping these students envision a future where the student is able to escape from poverty (DeJaeghere et al., 2016). 
	Another relevant theoretical framework to this study is the correspondence principle proposed by Bowles and Gintis. This principle argues that the school system in the United States was designed to create employees that are conformed to workplace policies; these employees are inherently obedient to workplace policy and upper management, accustomed to tedious work, and accept hierarchical structures within the workplace. The correspondence principle suggests that rather than enhancing an individual’s income and social mobility, school regulations, policies, and course structures promote social class segregation and oppression of minority and low socioeconomic groups. By evaluating the predictability of the ACT WorkKeys assessments as an entrance exam, it is important to examine the correspondence principle and consider policy reforms that promote social equality for individuals who are already disadvantaged. 
Assumptions, Limitations, and Scope 
	This study assumes data collected on students is accurate. However, this study acknowledges potential sources of inaccuracies in this data could be caused by human error, or limitations in tracking student outcomes (Complete College America, 2022). Instructors at C-TEC Postsecondary are responsible for following up with students post-graduation or withdrawal, but outdated or incorrect contact information in the school’s database can be an obstacle in obtaining this information. While state databases can provide some assistance in tracking student employment outcomes, the effectiveness of this method may be limited for students who move out of state. 
	Additionally, this study recognizes that the rigor and complexity of both academic and hands-on abilities required by different programs within C-TEC Postsecondary may contribute to variations in student outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a significant impact on a portion of the population being studied, which limits this study’s ability to conduct a more comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, the results of this study may be limited to the specific demographics, programs, and funding available at C-TEC Postsecondary, and may not necessarily be generalizable to other institutions. 
	The study focuses specifically on students over the age of 18 who enrolled in a program at C-TEC Postsecondary during the previous 5 fiscal years (2022, 2021, 2019, 2018, and 2017), and primarily consists of rural and suburban individuals. The data used in this study was limited to students who successfully met the minimum required cut scores on the three ACT WorkKeys assessments, determined by their desired program, and no specific programs were targeted for analysis. Data analysis for this study was performed using R studio (R Core Studio, 2022).
